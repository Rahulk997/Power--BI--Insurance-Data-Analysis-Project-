# Power BI Insurance Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of insurance data using Power BI, focusing on key metrics and trends to help company make informed decisions, improve operational efficiency, and understand customer behavior. The project utilizes Power BIâ€™s data transformation, modeling, and visualization capabilities to create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## Project Overview
- **Data Transformation**: Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships between tables (e.g., Customers, Claims, Policies) were established to support comprehensive analytics.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic visuals such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and KPI cards allow users to explore data easily.
- **Drill-Through Analysis**: Drill-through functionality was implemented to let users dive deeper into specific data points, such as exploring claim details by customer segment.
- **Scheduled Data Refresh**: The report is published in the Power BI Service with a scheduled refresh to ensure that the dashboard remains up-to-date with the latest data.
- **Role-Based Security**: Roles were created in Power BI Service to control access and provide data-level security, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.


## Key Metrics and Insights

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify customer segments by age, location, and policy type.
- **Claims Analysis**: Understand patterns in claim frequency, claim amount, and claim type distribution.
- **Revenue and Profitability**: Track the revenue generated from policies, claims payouts, and overall profitability.
